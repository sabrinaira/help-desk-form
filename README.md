I made this quick Help Desk Form to copy and paste onto any communicative platform like Slack, so that it is more efficient to type up everything and copy the whole text onto your clipboard with the questions included.

3. Finally, click on the <b>COPY</b> button to copy the text onto your clipboard!

Once you paste your text on Slack messenger, use this following keyboard command to automatically implement the markdown formatting built in Slack: <br>
Windows: `CTRL + Shift + F` <br>
MacOS: `CMD + Shift + F`
